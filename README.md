# Myntra Chatbot Integration  

###  Overview 
This project was developed as part of the **Myntra 'We for She' Hackathon**, where over 29,643 teams competed, and our idea ranked in the **Top 20**.  
The goal of this project was to integrate an **advanced AI-powered chatbot** into a **Myntra clone**, providing users with **personalized and budget-friendly fashion recommendations** based on their preferences and behavior.  

The chatbot leverages **natural language processing (NLP)** to engage with users seamlessly and enhance their shopping experience. The platform was built from scratch to showcase the chatbot's functionality effectively.

### Features  
- **Personalized Recommendations**: The chatbot suggests fashion products based on user preferences, shopping behavior, and budget constraints.  
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrated into a fully functional Myntra-like e-commerce platform.  
- **Interactive Conversations**: AI-driven responses for a natural and engaging user experience.  
- **Budget-Specific Insights**: Tailors suggestions within user-defined budget ranges.  

---

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Chatbot Framework**: Voiceflow (used for designing and implementing the chatbot logic)  
- **Web Scraping**: Python scripts to scrape fashion product data for recommendations  
- **Automation Testing**: Selenium for testing chatbot interactions  
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code
